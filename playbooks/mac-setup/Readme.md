# Ansible Playbook for Mac Development Setup

This playbook installs the minimal setup for (web) development which I use on my Mac. Also this is my way to make the first steps with [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/). One key source to get everything up and running is [geerlingguy/mac-dev-playbook](https://github.com/geerlingguy/mac-dev-playbook).

## Installation

1. Install Apple's command line tools (can be evoked through `xcode-select --install`)
2. [Install Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html#latest-releases-on-mac-osx)
